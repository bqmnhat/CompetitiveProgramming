<H2>USACO JAN09 Problem 'baric' Analysis</H2>
<H4>by Richard Peng</H4>
<P>The problem can be solved by dynamic programming. We turn this problem into 
the following: partial the array into k+1 segments such that the total error is 
minimized. The division points between consecutive segments correspond to the 
measurement and once we computed this information for all k, the answer can be 
extrated. 
<P>Given a single interval, the error can be computed by looping through the 
elements. Of course, special cases are needed for the intervals starting at the 
begining or ending with the last entry. 
<P>Then to compute best[i,k] when k&gt;2, consider the interval the last element 
is involved in. If it's at j, then the best value of the segment is best[j,k-1] 
along with the error of the interval [i,j] using 1 measurement (which we compute 
earlier). 
<P>There are O(N^2) states of the DP, with O(n) possible transitoins. Along with 
the precomputation, the algorithm takes O(n^3). </P></BODY></HTML>
