<H2>USACO JAN09 Problem 'mnoteb' Analysis</H2>
<H4>by Rob Kolstad</H4>
<P>This problem asks "which note is played at time t" where the times are 
"bucketized" -- they are discrete integers in a half-open, half-closed interval 
that lends itself perfectly to creating an array of which note is play at time 
T_i. C and Java programmers can even subscript the array directly with T_i! 
<P>How to create such an array? Probably the easiest way is to keep two counters 
to insert note values into array. The sample solution below uses 'notesin' to 
keep track of where the next note is to be stored and 'i' to keep track of which 
note is to be stored there. We increase 'notesin' every time we store a note; we 
increase 'i' every time we read a new note from the input. 
<P>Then it's a simple case of simply printing the answer from the calculated 
answer array. <PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int notes[10000];
main () {
    FILE *fin = fopen ("mnoteb.in", "r");
    FILE *fout = fopen ("mnoteb.out", "w");
    int i, j, n, q, b, notesin;

    notesin = 0;
    fscanf (fin, "%d %d", &amp;n, &amp;q);
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        fscanf (fin, "%d", &amp;b);
        for (j = 0; j &lt; b; j++)
            notes[notesin++] = i+1;
    }
    for (i = 0; i &lt; q; i++) {
        fscanf (fin, "%d", &amp;b);
        fprintf (fout, "%d\n", notes[b]);
    }
    exit (0);
